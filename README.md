## Project 1: Data Wrangling 

### Title
Data Wrangling utilizing AWS-Based Services for Vancouver Street Trees dataset.
### Objective 
In this project I assume the role of a member of the data team woking for the City of Vancouver. The aim was to design and implement Data Analytical Platform (DAP) hosted on AWS for the street-trees-dataset.
The primary objective of the wrangling is to perform data ingestion, profiling, cleaning, and transformation using AWS services to ensure that the dataset is clean, structured, and ready for further descriptive and exploratory analysis. The wrangling process demonstrats practical usage of AWS tools such as S3, Glue DataBrew, and Glue pipelines to prepare the dataset for effective analytics.
