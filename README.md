## Project 1: Data Wrangling 

### Title
Data Wrangling utilizing AWS-Based Services for Vancouver Street Trees dataset.

### Objective 
In this project I assume the role of a member of the data team woking for the City of Vancouver. The aim was to design and implement Data Analytical Platform (DAP) hosted on AWS for the street-trees-dataset.
The primary objective of the wrangling is to perform data ingestion, profiling, cleaning, and transformation using AWS services to ensure that the dataset is clean, structured, and ready for further descriptive and exploratory analysis. The wrangling process demonstrats practical usage of AWS tools such as S3, Glue DataBrew, and Glue pipelines to prepare the dataset for effective analytics.

### Background
The City of Vancouver maintains a list (excluding private owned trees and park trees) containing information on public trees planted along boulevards across Vancouver. The dataset includes inforamtion regarding the tree genus, species, dimensions, planting history, location, and geographical coordinates. The dataset is updated daily on weekdays but it may be several years between updates for some attributes.
Even with high update frequency, the dataset contains missing values, inconsistencies, incomplete records, and duplication issues which might make analysis challenging. This project prepares this data for meaningful analysis by integrating it into an AWS-based services. The insight generated from future analysis of this data can facilitate informed decision making regarding urban forestry, improving tree maintenance strategies and resource allocation in alignment with the city’s sustainability goals.

### Dataset
The dataset provides information details on over 180,000 public trees. For this analysis, (given the resouces constraints of utilizing the AWS services as a student) a subset of 526 records was selected, focusing just on trees with genus-Malus and species-XX. Key features of the dataset include:
- TREE_ID: Unique numerical identifier for each tree.
- CIVIC_NUMBER: Street address of the tree's location.
- STD_STREET: Name of the street where the tree is located.
- COMMON_NAME: Common name (e.g., Scotch Pine).
- ASSIGNED: Indicates if the address is made up (Y/N).
- ROOT_BARRIER: Whether a root barrier is installed (Y/N).
- PLANT_AREA: Location type (e.g., behind sidewalk, tree grate).
- ON_STREET_BLOCK: Street block where the tree is located.
- ON_STREET: The name of the street the tree is physically on.
- NEIGHBOURHOOD_NAME: Local area where the tree is planted.
- STREET_SIDE_NAME: Side of the street (Even, Odd, Median).
- HEIGHT_RANGE: Height range of the tree in feet.
- Height_Range_id: An ID representing the tree’s height range, coresspoinding to a specific height interval. (e.g.,0,1)
- DIAMETER: Tree trunk diameter at breast height (in inches).
- CURB: Whether the tree is on a curb (Y/N).
- DATE_PLANTED: Date the tree was planted.
- geo_point_2d: Geospatial coordinates in [latitude, longitude] format.
